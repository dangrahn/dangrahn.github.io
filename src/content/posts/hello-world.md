Welcome to my blog! This will be the home for any writing I feel is worth being shared. About any topic that interests or falls to mind.

I should probably have started this way earlier in my life. I have tried, but didn't really appreciate it then. I hope the older me will approach this more open minded and see the beauty in writing and sharing what goes though my mind.

Many years from now I hope I will look back at my writing and feel proud of it. Let's see what the future brings.
